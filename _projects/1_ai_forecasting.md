This project was developed during my Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Oxford, Lady Margaret Hall, in summer 2023. The focus was on applying machine learning techniques to financial time-series analysis and signal detection.

## Project Overview

The main objectives were to:

- Build robust time-series forecasting models for mean-reversion signals
- Develop trend analysis algorithms using regression and neural networks
- Apply convolutional neural network architectures to detect spatiotemporal patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Models Developed

- **Regression-based forecasting models** for baseline trend detection
- **Neural network architectures** for complex pattern recognition
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for spatiotemporal pattern detection in financial sequences

### Key Features

- Python-based implementation using standard ML libraries
- Focus on mean-reversion signal detection in simulated financial data
- Integration of multiple modeling approaches for robust prediction

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Machine Learning**: Regression, Neural Networks, CNNs
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Trend detection, Signal processing
- **Programming**: Advanced Python implementation
- **Financial Modeling**: Application to market data patterns

This project provided valuable experience in applying theoretical machine learning concepts to practical financial forecasting problems, laying the groundwork for my current research interests in Bayesian inference and Neural Processes.
