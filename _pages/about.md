I am a mathematics student with a strong research focus on **Bayesian inference**, **Neural Processes**, and **machine learning theory**. Currently pursuing an MPhil in Mathematics at the **University of Cambridge** as a **La Caixa Fellow**, I am conducting research under Prof. Sergio Bacallado on scalable and amortized Bayesian inference frameworks.

Previously, I completed my BSc in Mathematics at **Universidad de Sevilla** with a final average of 9.33/10, where 26 out of 30 modules were passed with honors. I am currently on exchange at the **University of Warwick** as an Erasmus and Santander Scholar, expecting to graduate with First Class honors.

My research interests span **amortized Bayesian inference**, **meta-learning**, and **feature selection using quiver representations**. I have been selected for prestigious research positions, including a summer fellowship at the **Aalto Science Institute** in Helsinki, where I collaborate with Dr. Vikas Garg on Post-Bayesian methods for Neural Processes.

I am passionate about developing robust statistical methods that can generalize across tasks and contribute to the theoretical foundations of machine learning. My work combines mathematical rigor with practical applications in time-series forecasting and financial modeling.
